## Question 1

> Home Builder Supply, a retailer in the home improvement industry, currently
> operates seven retail outlets in Georgia and South Carolina. Management is
> contemplating building an eighth retail store across town from its most
> successful retail outlet. The company already owns the land for this store,
> which currently has an abandoned warehouse located on it. Last month, the
> marketing department spent \$15,000 on market research to determine the extent
> of customer demand for the new store. Now, Home Builder Supply must decide
> whether to build and open the new store.
>
> What are the incremental cash flows?

- The cost of demolishing the abandoned warehouse and clearing the lot.
- The loss of sales in the existing retail outlet, if customers who previously
drove across town to shop at the existing outlet become customers of the new
store instead.
- Construction costs for the new store.
- The value of the land if sold.

## Question 2

> You work for Apple. After toiling away on \$10.7 million worth of prototypes,
> you have finally produced your answer to Google Glasses: iGlasses. iGlasses
> will instantly transport the wearer into the world as Apple wants her to
> experience it: iTunes with the blink of an eye and apps that can be activated
> just by looking at them. You think that these will sell for five years until
> the next big thing comes along (i.e. Galaxy Glass). Revenues are projected to
> be \$442.1 million per year along with expenses of \$350.3 million. You will
> need to spend \$64 million immediately on additional equipment that will be
> depreciated using the 5-year MACRS schedule.
>
> __Note:__ Depreciation starts in
> year 1. From year 1 to year 6, depreciation is \$12.8m, \$20.48m, \$12.29m,
> \$7.37m, \$7.37m, \$3.69m.
>
> Additionally, you will use some fully depreciated existing equipment that has
> a market value of \$9.9 million. As the iGlasses are an outcome of the R&D
> center (but iGlasses no longer use any resource of the R&D center), Apple
> plans to charge \$5 million of the annual costs of the center to the iGlass
> product for four years in its earnings report. Finally, Apple’s working
> capital levels will increase from their current level of \$121 million to
> \$141.2 million immediately. They will remain at the elevated level until Year
> 4, and they will return to \$121 million in Year 5. Apple’s discount rate for
> this project is 14.5% and its tax rate is 35%. Revenue, costs, and
> depreciation all start in Year 1.
>
> What is the net present value (NPV) of the project?

The net present value of the project is about \$137.67 million.

## Question 3

> US Steel is considering adding an additional furnace that will operate for ten
> years, starting in Year 1 (currently, it’s Year 0). Last year the company
> commissioned a feasibility study that costs \$1 million. The study came up
> with the following numbers. The new furnace costs \$1,000 million, which will
> be spent in Year 0, and has a salvage value of \$200 million at the end of the
> ten-year period. Using the new furnace increases sales by \$150 million per
> year and involves operating expenses of \$10 million per year. Moreover,
> working capital requirements increase by \$20 million immediately (added back
> once the project is over). According to IRS, the new furnace must be
> depreciated straight line over 8 years. The new furnace will need parts from
> an old furnace US Steel already owns. The old furnace is fully depreciated and
> has after-tax resale value of \$30 million in Year 0. Without the parts, the
> old furnace has no resale value. The corporate tax rate is 35% and the cost of
> capital is 10%. Revenue, costs, and depreciation all start in Year 1. Should
> US Steel go ahead with the new furnace? Draw your own table to calculate free
> cash flows. Provide details on how you get to each line of items.

No, US Steel should not go ahead with the new furnace.

![Problem Set 3 Question 3](../images/problem-set-3-3.png "Problem Set 3 Question 3")

The net present value is about -\$199.61 million.

## Question 4

> Nvidia is considering a proposal to manufacture high-speed GPUs. The project
> would make use of an existing warehouse which is currently rented out to a
> neighboring firm, starting in Year 1 when the manufacturing begins (currently
> it’s Year 0). At Year 1, rental charge on the warehouse is \$100,000 and this
> number is expected to grow at 4% per year. In addition to using the warehouse,
> the proposal envisages an investment in plant and equipment of \$1.2 million.
> Depreciation is \$120,000 per year. Nvidia expects to terminate the project
> after eight years and to resell the plant and equipment then (i.e., in Year 8)
> for \$400,000. The project requires an initial (Year 0) investment in working
> capital of \$350,000. Thereafter, working capital is forecasted to be 10% of
> sales in each of years 1 through 7 (0 in Year 8). The first year’s sales of
> these GPUs are expected to be \$4.2 million and thereafter sales are
> forecasted to grow by 5% per year. Manufacturing costs are expected to be 90%
> of sales. The corporate tax rate is 35%, real estate income tax is 35%, and
> the cost of capital is 12%. Revenue, costs, and depreciation all start in Year
> \1. What is the NPV of the project? Draw your own table to calculate free cash
> flows. Provide details on how you get to each line of items.

![Problem Set 3 Question 4](../images/problem-set-3-4.png "Problem Set 3 Question 4")

The net present value is about \$85.80 thousand.
