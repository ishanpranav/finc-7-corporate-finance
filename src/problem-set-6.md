## Definitions

Let $V$ represent the value of an asset

Let $r_{\rm tax}$ represent the tax rate of a firm, $r_{\rm D}$ represent its
cost of debt, and $V_{\rm D}$ represent the value of its debt.

## Question 1

> Milton Industries expects free cash flows of $14 million each year. Milton's
> corporate tax rate is 21%, and its unlevered cost of capital is 15%. Milton
> also has outstanding debt of $23.44 million, and it expects to maintain this
> level of debt permanently.

### Question 1 Part A

> What is the value of Milton Industries without leverage?

$$V=\frac{\$14\text{ million}}{15\%}=\$93.\overline{3}\text{ million}.$$

Without leverage, the value of Milton Industries is about $93.33 million.

### Question 1 Part B

With leverage, the firm enjoys the benefit of a tax deduction on interest
expenses. Let $V'$ represent the value of the firm with leverage.

$$V'=V+\frac{r_{\rm tax}r_{\rm D}V_{\rm D}}{r_{\rm D}},$$

$$V'=\$93.\overline{3}\text{ million}+(21\%\times\$23.44\text{ million}),$$

$$V'\approx\$98.2557\text{ million}\dots.$$

With leverage, the value of Milton Industries is about $98.26 million.

## Question 2

> Zymase is a biotechnology start-up firm. Researchers at Zymase must choose one
> of three different research strategies. The payoffs (after-tax) and their
> likelihood for each strategy are shown below. The risk of each project is
> diversifiable.

| Strategy | Probability (%) | Payoff ($ million) |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| A        |             100 |                 65 |
| B        |              50 |                120 |
|          |              50 |                  0 |
| C        |              10 |                270 |
|          |              90 |                 30 |

### Question 2 Part A

> Which project has the highest expected payoff?

#### Table 1: Firm value

| Strategy | Expected payoff ($ million) |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| A        | 65                          |
| B        | 60                          |
| C        | 29.7                        |

Strategy A has the highest expected payoff.

### Question 2 Part B

> Suppose Zymase has debt of $30 million due at the time of the project's
> payoff. Which strategy has the highest expected payoff for equity holders?

#### Table 2: Equity holders with $30 million in debt

| Strategy | Probability (%) | Payoff ($ million) |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| A        |             100 |                 35 |
| B        |              50 |                 90 |
|          |              50 |                  0 |
| C        |              10 |                240 |
|          |              90 |                  0 |

| Strategy | Expected payoff ($ million) |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| A        |                          35 |
| B        |                          45 |
| C        |                          24 |

Strategy B has the highest expected payoff for equity holders if the firm has
$30 million in debt.

### Question 2 Part C

> Suppose Zymase has debt of $130 million due at the time of the project's
> payoff. Which strategy has the highest expected payoff for equity holders?

#### Table 3: Equity holders with $130 million in debt

| Strategy | Probability (%) | Payoff ($ million) |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| A        |             100 |                  0 |
| B        |              50 |                  0 |
|          |              50 |                  0 |
| C        |              10 |                140 |
|          |              90 |                  0 |

| Strategy | Expected payoff ($ million) |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| A        |                           0 |
| B        |                           0 |
| C        |                          14 |

Strategy C has the highest expected payoff for equity holders if the firm has
$130 million in debt.

### Question 2 Part D

> If management chooses the strategy that maximizes the payoff to equity
> holders, what is the expected agency cost to the firm from having $30 million
> in debt due? What is the expected agency cost to the firm from having $130
> million in debt due?

The expected agency cost to the firm from having $30 million in debt due is $5
million. The expected agency cost from having $130 million in debt is $35.3
million.

## Question 3

> KMS Corporation has assets of $650 million, $130 million of which are cash. It
> has debt of $216.7 million. Suppose KMS repurchases $32.5 million of its stock
> using its cash reserve.

### Question 3 Part A

> What changes will occur on its balance sheet?

#### Table 4: Balance sheet before stock repurchase

|  |           KMS Corporation          |  |
|:-|:----------------------------------:|-:|
||           **Balance Sheet**            ||
|||                          in $ millions |
| **ASSETS**                    ||         |
| Cash                          ||  130.0  |
| Other assets                  ||  520.0  |
| **Total assets**              ||**650.0**|
| **LIABILITIES**               ||         |
| Debt payable                  ||  216.7  |
| **Total liabilities**         ||**216.7**|
| **SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY**      ||         |
| **Total shareholder's equity**||**433.3**|

#### Table 5: Balance sheet after stock repurchase

|  |           KMS Corporation          |  |
|:-|:----------------------------------:|-:|
||           **Balance Sheet**            ||
|||                          in $ millions |
| **ASSETS**                    ||         |
| Cash                          ||   97.5  |
| Other assets                  ||  520.0  |
| **Total assets**              ||**617.5**|
| **LIABILITIES**               ||         |
| Debt payable                  ||  216.7  |
| **Total liabilities**         ||**216.7**|
| **SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY**      ||         |
| **Total shareholder's equity**||**400.8**|

Both the cash balance and the shareholders' equity will decrease by $32.5
million.

### Question 3 Part B

> What will be its new debt-to-equity ratio?

The new debt-to-equity ratio of the firm is about 0.54.

## Question 4

> Natsam Corporation has $285 million of excess cash. The firm has no debt and
> 549 million shares outstanding with a current market price of $11 per share
> (before the _ex_-dividend date). Natsam's board has decided to pay out this
> cash as a one-time dividend.

### Question 4 Part A

> What is the _ex_-dividend price of a share in a perfect capital market?

Let $v$ represent the _cum_-dividend price, $d$ represent the dividend, and $v'$
represent the _ex_-dividend price.

$$v'=v-d,$$

$$v'=\$11-\frac{285\text{ million}}{549\text{ million shares}},$$

$$v'\approx\$10.4593\dots\text{ per share}.$$

The _ex_-dividend price is about $10.46.

### Question 4 Part B

> If the board instead decided to use the cash to do a one-time share
> repurchase, in a perfect capital market, what is the price of the shares once
> the repurchase is complete?

In a perfect capital market, the share price after the repurchase is about $10.46.

### Question 4 Part C

> In a perfect capital market, which policy in Part A or Part B makes investors
> in the firm better off?

In a perfect capital market, all payout policies are equivalent.

## Question 5

> You purchased CSH stock for $39 and it is now selling for $48. The company has
> announced that it plans a $9 special dividend.

Assume an efficient market. Assume there are no changes in the economic value of
the firm during the relevant period.

### Question 5 Part A

> Assuming tax rates of 15% on dividends and capital gains, if you sell the
> stock or wait and receive the dividend, will you have different after-tax
> income?

Since the dividend and capital gains rate are the same, there will be
no difference in after-tax income.

### Question 5 Part B

> Assuming the capital gains tax rate is 19% and the dividend tax rate is 38%,
> if you sell the stock or wait and receive the dividend, will you have
> different after-tax income?
