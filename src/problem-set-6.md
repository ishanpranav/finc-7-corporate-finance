## Definitions

Let $V$ represent the value of an asset

Let $r_{\rm tax}$ represents the tax rate of a firm, $r_{\rm D}$ represent its
cost of debt, and $V_{\rm D}$ represent the value of its debt.

## Question 1

> Milton Industries expects free cash flows of $14 million each year. Milton's
> corporate tax rate is 21%, and its unlevered cost of capital is 15%. Milton
> also has outstanding debt of $23.44 million, and it expects to maintain this
> level of debt permanently.

### Question 1 Part A

> What is the value of Milton Industries without leverage?

$$V=\frac{\$14\text{ million}}{15\%}=\$93.\overline{3}\text{ million}.$$

Without leverage, the value of Milton Industries is about $93.33 million.

### Question 1 Part B

With leverage, the firm enjoys the benefit of a tax deduction on interest
expenses. Let $V'$ represent the value of the firm with leverage.

$$V'=V+\frac{r_{\rm tax}r_{\rm D}V_{\rm D}}{r_{\rm D}},$$

$$V'=\$93.\overline{3}\text{ million}+(21\%\times\$23.44\text{ million}),$$

$$V'\approx\$98.2557\text{ million}\dots.$$

With leverage, the value of Milton Industries is about $98.26 million.
