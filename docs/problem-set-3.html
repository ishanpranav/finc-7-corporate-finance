    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Home Builder Supply, a retailer in the home improvement industry,
        currently operates seven retail outlets in Georgia and South Carolina.
        Management is contemplating building an eighth retail store across town
        from its most successful retail outlet. The company already owns the
        land for this store, which currently has an abandoned warehouse located
        on it. Last month, the marketing department spent $15,000 on market
        research to determine the extent of customer demand for the new store.
        Now, Home Builder Supply must decide whether to build and open the new
        store.
      </p>
      <p>What are the incremental cash flows?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The cost of demolishing the abandoned warehouse and clearing the lot.
      </li>
      <li>
        The loss of sales in the existing retail outlet, if customers who
        previously drove across town to shop at the existing outlet become
        customers of the new store instead.
      </li>
      <li>Construction costs for the new store.</li>
      <li>The value of the land if sold.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        You work for Apple. After toiling away on $10.7 million worth of
        prototypes, you have finally produced your answer to Google Glasses:
        iGlasses. iGlasses will instantly transport the wearer into the world as
        Apple wants her to experience it: iTunes with the blink of an eye and
        apps that can be activated just by looking at them. You think that these
        will sell for five years until the next big thing comes along (i.e.
        Galaxy Glass). Revenues are projected to be $442.1 million per year
        along with expenses of $350.3 million. You will need to spend $64
        million immediately on additional equipment that will be depreciated
        using the 5-year MACRS schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Depreciation starts in year 1. From year 1 to
        year 6, depreciation is $12.8m, $20.48m, $12.29m, $7.37m, $7.37m,
        $3.69m.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, you will use some fully depreciated existing equipment
        that has a market value of $9.9 million. As the iGlasses are an outcome
        of the R&amp;D center (but iGlasses no longer use any resource of the
        R&amp;D center), Apple plans to charge $5 million of the annual costs of
        the center to the iGlass product for four years in its earnings report.
        Finally, Apple’s working capital levels will increase from their current
        level of $121 million to $141.2 million immediately. They will remain at
        the elevated level until Year 4, and they will return to $121 million in
        Year 5. Apple’s discount rate for this project is 14.5% and its tax rate
        is 35%. Revenue, costs, and depreciation all start in Year 1.
      </p>
      <p>What is the net present value (NPV) of the project?</p>

        US Steel is considering adding an additional furnace that will operate
        for ten years, starting in Year 1 (currently, it’s Year 0). Last year
        the company commissioned a feasibility study that costs $1 million. The
        study came up with the following numbers. The new furnace costs $1,000
        million, which will be spent in Year 0, and has a salvage value of $200
        million at the end of the ten-year period. Using the new furnace
        increases sales by $150 million per year and involves operating expenses
        of $10 million per year. Moreover, working capital requirements increase
        by $20 million immediately (added back once the project is over).
        According to IRS, the new furnace must be depreciated straight line over
        8 years. The new furnace will need parts from an old furnace US Steel
        already owns. The old furnace is fully depreciated and has after-tax
        resale value of $30 million in Year 0. Without the parts, the old
        furnace has no resale value. The corporate tax rate is 35% and the cost
        of capital is 10%. Revenue, costs, and depreciation all start in Year 1.
        Should US Steel go ahead with the new furnace? Draw your own table to
        calculate free cash flows. Provide details on how you get to each line
        of items.

    <p>No, US Steel should not go ahead with the new furnace.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Nvidia is considering a proposal to manufacture high-speed GPUs. The
        project would make use of an existing warehouse which is currently
        rented out to a neighboring firm, starting in Year 1 when the
        manufacturing begins (currently it’s Year 0). At Year 1, rental charge
        on the warehouse is $100,000 and this number is expected to grow at 4%
        per year. In addition to using the warehouse, the proposal envisages an
        investment in plant and equipment of $1.2 million. Depreciation is
        $120,000 per year. Nvidia expects to terminate the project after eight
        years and to resell the plant and equipment then (i.e., in Year 8) for
        $400,000. The project requires an initial (Year 0) investment in working
        capital of $350,000. Thereafter, working capital is forecasted to be 10%
        of sales in each of years 1 through 7 (0 in Year 8). The first year’s
        sales of these GPUs are expected to be $4.2 million and thereafter sales
        are forecasted to grow by 5% per year. Manufacturing costs are expected
        to be 90% of sales. The corporate tax rate is 35%, real estate income
        tax is 35%, and the cost of capital is 12%. Revenue, costs, and
        depreciation all start in Year \1. What is the NPV of the project? Draw
        your own table to calculate free cash flows. Provide details on how you
        get to each line of items.
